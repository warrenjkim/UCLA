To find the commit(s) that fixed the segmentation fault, I did

git log v2.38.0..v2.39.0 --grep 'fix.*segmentation fault'

which returned all the commits between version 2.38.0 and 2.39.0 which matched the phrases "fix segmentation fault" and "fixed segmentation fault".

git diff 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc^ 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

which returned the changes made to fix the issue.
