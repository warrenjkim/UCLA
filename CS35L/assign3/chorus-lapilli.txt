- Take the tic-tac-toe code we used in the tutorial.
- Start by adding a counter for both X and O that gets incremented any time a new piece is added to the board.
- Stop adding pieces to the board once a player has 3 pieces on the board (after 6 iterations). I implemented this in a conditional.
- Add instructions for how to play in chorus mode.
- When we're moving pieces, we need to check for 2 button presses. We should let the user undo their moves. So, we only change turns when the user makes a valid move.
- The first click marks the piece they want to move, and the second click is their desired destination.
- Note that we want to add a piece (if we can) last, because we need to check to make sure we aren't in chorus mode first.
- We need to error check for adjacency and if the cell is already occupied => done in conditionals.
- For ease of computation (and intuition), create helper functions to change from index notation to matrix notation (e.g. i = 3 is [1, 0]) to determine adjacency.
- For ease of reading, create a board variable that contains the game board.

- HOW TO PLAY
- when adding pieces: click on the desired cell.
- when MOVING pieces: click once to mark the piece you want to move (should "take away" the piece). click a second time to move the piece to the desired location. NOTE: the program will not let you make any invalid moves. Therefore, if you have a center piece and try to move a different piece, the only option is to undo and move a center piece.
