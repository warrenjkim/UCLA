C-h k C-h k describes how the C-h k command works. This is because when C-h k is invoked, it calles the describe-key command which will wait for a second set of commands, giving information on said command. C-h k runs the command describe-key (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘help.el’.

It is bound to C-h k, <f1> k, <help> k, <menu-bar> <help-menu> <describe> <describe-key-1>.

C-h k M-SPC describes how the M-SPC command works. This is because when C-h k is invoked, it calles the describe-key command which will wait for a second set of commands, giving information on said command. M-SPC runs the command just-one-space (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to M-SPC.

Homework
1. when the script is invoked on an empty file, it prints an error from python's random package.

2. when invoking the script in python3, there is a syntax error because StandardError was deprecated, and you must now package up your error arguments instead of passing multiple arguments into the function.

3. my implementation of shuf.py does not work on Python2 because it uses the f-string feature which was implemented in Python 3.6

4. my implementation of shuf.py does not work on the older Python3 because it uses the match case feature which was implemented in Python 3.10.
