Note: X subtype Y <==> Y supertype X

* Int is a subtype of Integer
* Float is a subtype of Fractional
* Integer and Fractional are subtypes of Num

1b)
div and mod operate on Integers (and therefore Ints), while + operates
on Nums. This is due to Haskell's type system and restrictions on
certain operations. While Integers are subtypes of Nums and therefore
can do the same set of operations as Nums, they have extra integer
arithmetic that Fractionals don't have.

Note: X subtype Y <==> Y supertype X

* float is a subtype of const float
* int is a subtype of const int
* float and int have no relation to each other

1d)
boolean subtype of int in Python
True * 1 = 1 since boolean is a subtype of int in Python
