One difference between my cloned git and ~eggert/src/github/git is that there are multiple branches (maint, ext, seen, todo) in the eggert directory's git while mine only has the master branch when doing

git branch

Another difference is that the git in eggert's directory is about a week out of date with the one I cloned doing the assignment. Using

git log HEAD^!

I found that the most recent commit was Feb 15 at 16:08:41 while the eggert directory's was listed as Feb 8 at 09:14:42.
