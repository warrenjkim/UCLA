1. sh, and type are located in /usr/bin. sleep is located in /usr/local/cs/bin
which sh sleep type RET

2. sed and seq are executable programs in /usr/bin that are exactly 3 characters long and start with "se".
which /usr/bin/se? RET
info sed information RET
info seq information RET


sed: sed' is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text
transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
(such as 'ed'), 'sed' works by making only one pass over the input(s),
and is consequently more efficient.  But it is 'sed''s ability to filter
text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types
of editors.

seq: ‘seq’ prints the numbers from FIRST to LAST by INCREMENT.  By
default, each number is printed on a separate line.  When INCREMENT is
not specified, it defaults to ‘1’, even when FIRST is larger than LAST.
FIRST also defaults to ‘1’.  So ‘seq 1’ prints ‘1’, but ‘seq 0’ and ‘seq
10 5’ produce no output.  The sequence of numbers ends when the sum of
the current number and INCREMENT would become greater than LAST, so ‘seq
1 10 10’ only produces ‘1’.  INCREMENT must not be ‘0’; use the tool
‘yes’ to get repeated output of a constant number.  FIRST, INCREMENT and
LAST must not be ‘NaN’, but ‘inf’ is supported.  Floating-point numbers
may be specified in either the current or the C locale.

3. The file that is executed by the symbolic link is /usr/local/cs/emacs-28.2/bin/emacs-28.2
ls -l /usr/local/cs/bin/emacs RET

4. The version of /usr/bin/gcc is 8.5.0 20210514. The version of the palin gcc is 12.2.0. They're different because they're two different installations of gcc. The gcc version we use is the one in /usr/local/cs/bin because we prepended it to our .profile.
gcc --version RET

12. My own login shell's process: 2979163, its descendent(s): 2979224, its ancestors: 2979161 (sshd: warren@pts/12), 2979157 (sshd: warren [priv]), 1699 (/usr/sbin/sshd -D), 1 (/usr/lib/systemd/systemd). The shellscript "printpstree" will print my own login shell's process and all of its ancestors and descendents.
